## [EM vs REM vs PX – Why you shouldn't “just use pixels”] (https://engageinteractive.co.uk/blog/em-vs-rem-vs-px)

## TL;DR:
- Pixels are ignorant, don’t use them.
- Use REMs for sizes and spacing.
- Use EMs for media queries.


## Using REM
- Set the root HTML font-size as a precentage.
- A good number is 62.5% because 62.5 of 16px (typical default browser font-size) is 10px.
